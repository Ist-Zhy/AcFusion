# AcFusion:Infrared and visible image fusion based on self-attention and convolution with enhanced information extraction
This is the official PyTorch implementation of AcFusion:Infrared and visible image fusion based on self-attention and convolution with enhanced information extraction. We use the following datasets in this post:
* [MSRS](https://github.com/Linfeng-Tang/PIAFusion)
* [RoadScene](https://github.com/hanna-xu/RoadScene)
* [TNO](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/TNO_Image_Fusion_Dataset/1008029)
* [M3FD](https://github.com/dlut-dimt/TarDAL)
  
Links to the checkpoints can be found in the inference description below.

## Architecture
